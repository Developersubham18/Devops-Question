Kubernetes Interview Questions and Answers 
1. What is Kubernetes?

Answer:
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications automatically.

2. What problem does Kubernetes solve?

Answer:
It solves problems like container scaling, self-healing, load balancing, rolling updates, and service discovery.

3. What is a Kubernetes cluster?

Answer:
A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.

4. What are the main components of a Kubernetes cluster?

Answer:

Control Plane

Worker Nodes

5. What is the Control Plane?

Answer:
The Control Plane manages the cluster and makes decisions like scheduling, scaling, and maintaining desired state.

6. Name Control Plane components.

Answer:

kube-apiserver

etcd

kube-scheduler

kube-controller-manager

7. What is a Worker Node?

Answer:
A Worker Node runs application workloads (Pods).

8. Name Worker Node components.

Answer:

kubelet

kube-proxy

Container runtime (Docker, containerd)

9. What is a Pod?

Answer:
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes and can contain one or more containers.

10. Why are Pods not created directly in production?

Answer:
Pods are not self-healing and do not support scaling or rolling updates.

11. What is a Deployment?

Answer:
A Deployment manages Pods and provides scaling, self-healing, rolling updates, and rollback.

12. What is a ReplicaSet?

Answer:
A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at all times.

13. Relationship between Deployment, ReplicaSet, and Pod?

Answer:
Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pods

14. What is a Service?

Answer:
A Service provides a stable network endpoint to access Pods.

15. Why is Service required?

Answer:
Because Pod IPs are dynamic and change when Pods restart.

16. Types of Kubernetes Services?

Answer:

ClusterIP

NodePort

LoadBalancer

ExternalName

17. What is ClusterIP?

Answer:
A Service type accessible only within the cluster.

18. What is NodePort?

Answer:
A Service type that exposes the application on a static port on each node.

19. What is LoadBalancer?

Answer:
A Service type that provisions a cloud load balancer to expose the application externally.

20. What is Ingress?

Answer:
Ingress manages external HTTP/HTTPS access to Services using routing rules.

21. What is an Ingress Controller?

Answer:
A component that implements Ingress rules and routes traffic to Services.

22. Difference between Service and Ingress?

Answer:
Service works at Layer 4; Ingress works at Layer 7 and supports domain/path routing.

23. What are labels in Kubernetes?

Answer:
Key-value pairs used to identify and group Kubernetes resources.

24. What are selectors?

Answer:
Selectors match labels to connect resources like Services and Pods.

25. What is Namespace?

Answer:
A logical isolation mechanism used to organize resources within a cluster.

26. Default namespaces in Kubernetes?

Answer:

default

kube-system

kube-public

kube-node-lease

27. What is ConfigMap?

Answer:
A ConfigMap stores non-sensitive configuration data.

28. What is Secret?

Answer:
A Secret stores sensitive data like passwords, tokens, and keys.

29. Difference between ConfigMap and Secret?

Answer:
ConfigMap is for non-sensitive data; Secret is for sensitive data.

30. What is Volume in Kubernetes?

Answer:
A Volume provides persistent or shared storage for Pods.

31. What is PersistentVolume (PV)?

Answer:
A PersistentVolume is a cluster-level storage resource.

32. What is PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)?

Answer:
A request for storage by a Pod.

33. Difference between PV and PVC?

Answer:
PV is the actual storage; PVC is the request for storage.

34. What is StatefulSet?

Answer:
A workload controller for stateful applications like databases.

35. Difference between Deployment and StatefulSet?

Answer:
Deployment is for stateless apps; StatefulSet is for stateful apps with stable identity.

36. What is DaemonSet?

Answer:
Ensures one Pod runs on each node (e.g., logging, monitoring agents).

37. What is Job?

Answer:
A Job runs a Pod to completion for one-time tasks.

38. What is CronJob?

Answer:
A CronJob schedules Jobs to run at specific times.

39. What is kubectl?

Answer:
kubectl is the CLI tool used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

40. What is kubeadm?

Answer:
kubeadm is a tool to bootstrap Kubernetes clusters.

41. What is Minikube?

Answer:
Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally for learning.

42. What is KIND?

Answer:
KIND runs Kubernetes clusters inside Docker containers.

43. What is k3s?

Answer:
A lightweight Kubernetes distribution for edge and IoT use cases.

44. What is rolling update?

Answer:
A deployment strategy that updates Pods gradually without downtime.

45. What is rollback?

Answer:
Reverting an application to a previous stable version.

46. What is self-healing in Kubernetes?

Answer:
Automatically recreating failed Pods to maintain desired state.

47. What is scaling in Kubernetes?

Answer:
Increasing or decreasing the number of Pod replicas.

48. What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?

Answer:
Automatically scales Pods based on CPU or memory usage.

49. What is etcd?

Answer:
A distributed key-value store that stores cluster state and configuration.

50. Is Kubernetes stateless or stateful?

Answer:
Kubernetes itself is stateless, but it can manage both stateless and stateful applications.
